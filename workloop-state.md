# Workloop State

## 2026-05-27T04:20Z - opener recovered PR #145 Alembic double-head

- Automation: `pd-workloop-resume` (codex opener lane).
- Source repo: `stranske/learning-management-system`.
- Source issue: [#106](https://github.com/stranske/learning-management-system/issues/106) `Accept case work products as transfer evidence`.
- PR: [#145](https://github.com/stranske/learning-management-system/pull/145) `Issue #106: Accept case work products as transfer evidence`.
- Branch: `claude/issue-106-case-work-products`.
- Recovery trigger:
  - Post-open cap-health showed LMS #145 as `runner-failed` after keepalive/Gate evidence.
  - Direct Gate log for run `26490283524` showed five deterministic migration failures from Alembic multiple heads: `20260527_0027_case_work_products` and `20260527_0027_merge_revision_requests_llm_feedback_events`.
- Fix:
  - Created a clean automation clone at `~/.codex/automations/pd-workloop-resume/worktrees/lms-issue-106-recovery` because the older worktree's git metadata was not writable.
  - Rebased `claude/issue-106-case-work-products` onto `origin/main` after LMS #144 merged.
  - Repointed `alembic/versions/20260527_0027_case_work_products.py` `down_revision` to `20260527_0027_merge_revision_requests_llm_feedback_events`.
  - Committed `60064d0` (`Issue #106: rebase case work migration onto LLM feedback head`) and force-pushed with lease to the existing PR branch.
- Validation:
  - `alembic heads` -> single head `20260527_0027_case_work_products`.
  - `pytest tests/evidence/test_attempts_migration.py::test_alembic_upgrade_head_creates_attempts_table tests/evidence/test_attempts_migration.py::test_alembic_upgrade_head_creates_evidence_records_table tests/llm/test_llm_sessions_migration.py::test_alembic_upgrade_head_creates_llm_sessions_table tests/llm/test_llm_sessions_migration.py::test_llm_sessions_trace_class_constraint_rejects_unknown_value tests/scheduling/test_review_queue.py::test_alembic_upgrade_head_creates_review_queue_items_table -q --no-cov` -> 5 passed.

  - Cap-health at `2026-05-27T04:20:29Z` classified #145 as `draining` with active Gate evidence after the push.
